# Udacity - Data Engineering with AWS
## Project Title
Data Modeling with Apache Cassandra

## Description
This project involves creating a data model using Apache Cassandra for Sparkify, a music streaming startup. The goal is to analyze user activity data to understand what songs users are listening to. As a data engineer, you will design a Cassandra database and implement an ETL pipeline in Python to process raw CSV files and load the data into Cassandra tables. The project includes a provided template to help structure the ETL process. Your database will support queries needed by the analytics team to extract insights from the song play data.
